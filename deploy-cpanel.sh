CPANEL DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
=================================================

1. UPLOAD FILES TO CPANEL:
   - Upload ALL contents of the 'dist' folder to your cPanel public_html directory
   - Make sure to upload the .htaccess file as well (enable "Show hidden files" in File Manager)

2. CPANEL REQUIREMENTS:
   - Ensure your hosting supports:
     * Apache mod_rewrite (for SPA routing)
     * mod_deflate and mod_expires (for performance)
     * mod_headers (for security headers)

3. FILE STRUCTURE ON CPANEL:
   public_html/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .htaccess
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index-[hash].css
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index-[hash].js
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ robots.txt

4. TESTING:
   - Visit your domain after upload
   - Test navigation between pages
   - Check that direct URL access works (e.g., yourdomain.com/user-dashboard)
   - Verify that 404 errors redirect to the main app

5. TROUBLESHOOTING:
   - If routing doesn't work: Check .htaccess file is uploaded and mod_rewrite is enabled
   - If assets don't load: Verify file permissions (644 for files, 755 for directories)
   - If styles are broken: Clear browser cache and check CSS file paths

6. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Gzip compression is enabled via .htaccess
   - Browser caching is configured for static assets
   - Assets are minified and optimized

7. SECURITY:
   - Security headers are configured in .htaccess
   - Console logs are removed from production build
   - Source maps are disabled for security

=================================================
SUPPORT NOTES:
=================================================

- This is a Single Page Application (SPA)
- All routes are handled client-side by React Router
- The .htaccess file redirects all non-file requests to index.html
- Static assets are cached for 1 year for performance
- HTML files are not cached to ensure updates are immediate

For additional support, check your cPanel hosting documentation
or contact your hosting provider about React/SPA hosting requirements.
